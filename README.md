# Coalition-Race
Simulation of the "Coalition Race" Written in C++
The simulation of the "Coalition Race" in SPLand is based on a graph that contains political parties as vertices and collaborations as edges. The graph's edges are weighted with a "similarity score" that reflects how closely aligned two parties are in their political views.

The goal of the simulation is to find a coalition of parties that can form a government with a minimum of 61 seats in the parliament. The simulation will be run multiple times with different agents from different parties attempting to form a coalition as quickly as possible. The first successful coalition will be reported, or the simulation will indicate failure if no coalition can be formed.

To achieve this goal, the C++ program will implement various algorithms and data structures to efficiently search the graph for potential coalitions. The program will also make use of object-oriented programming principles and unique C++ properties, such as the "Rule of 5," to optimize performance and prevent memory leaks.
